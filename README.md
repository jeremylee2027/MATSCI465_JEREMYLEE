# MATSCI465_JEREMYLEE
Environment Setup and Data Exploration

This repository contains my submission for Week 01 of **MAT SCI 465: Advanced Electron Microscopy & Diffraction**.

## Contents
- `assignment_01_setup.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook demonstrating:
  - Python and OS version
  - Installed package versions (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, HyperSpy, py4DSTEM)
  - Import of all core libraries
  - Loading and visualization of an example EM image
  - Basic statistics (mean, standard deviation)
  - Histogram of pixel intensities
- `environment.yml` – Conda environment specification for reproducibility

## Environment
- Python: 3.11  
- Key packages: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, HyperSpy, py4DSTEM  
- Platform: macOS (Apple Silicon)

## Objective
Establish a reproducible computational environment and perform a first exploratory analysis of an electron microscopy dataset, following the Week 01 checklist provided in the course assignment.
